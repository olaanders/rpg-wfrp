# Dragon/Drake

_Of all the creatures that still roam the Old World, few are
 as mighty or awe inspiring as the Dragons. They are massive
 reptilian beasts, with vast leathery wings, and scales as
 hard as rock. Most of them are quadrupeds, but a few are
 bipeds. Almost all of those that live in the Empire dwell
 deep within the heart of the World’s Edge Mountains,
 sleeping for centuries at a time in sealed off caverns. They
 are an ancient and dying race, belonging to age long passed.
 Only a few hatchlings have been born in the last thousand
 years. Still, Dragons seem to only grow mightier with age
 and those that are left may yet have a part to play in the
 grand events of the world. Dragons are individualists and
 it is difficult to say what any given one will do in a fight
 with any certainty. Most warriors never survive to tell others
 what to expect when fighting a Dragon._

**Special Rules:**
* _Rending Attacks._ A Dragon’s natural weapons are so
razor-sharp that they count as having the Armour
Piercing and Impact Qualities.
* _Breathe Fire._ A Dragon can breathe fire as a full
action. Use the cone template. Those affected take
a Damage 8 hit. Note that some Dragons have a
different sort of breath weapon, such as a cloud of
acidic gas or a black miasma. The rules for such are
effectively the same.
* _Speed of Attack._ A Dragon has so many ways to
attack; teeth, claws, tail, even wings, that it can
attack twice with the standard attack action instead
of the normal once.
