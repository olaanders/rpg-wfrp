# Giant Wolf/Ulv

_Giant Wolves are huge grey animals, standing close to
 four feet at the shoulder. They are large enough that both
 Hobgoblins and Goblins can use them as cavalry mounts.
 Giant Wolves fear very little, and are quite prepared to
 attack Humans if they think the latter are at all weak.
 Giant Wolves tend to run in packs with around seven
 members when they are not being used as Greenskin
 mounts. Classic Giant Wolf tactics involve the use of two
 or even three separate groups of wolves, with one group
 chasing the prey into the waiting jaws of the others. A
 variant of this old wolf trick, used more by Giant Wolves
 than their more normal-sized counterparts, is the feigned
 retreat. Here, a small group of Giant Wolves will appear to
 flee their foes, only to lead them into an ambush._
