# Giant/Jätte

_Giants are enormous humanoids that usually stand around
18 feet tall, though a few may be considerably larger,
especially those touched by Chaos. Their clothing consists
of either crudely joined furs or robes stitched together from
material wrested from others more skilled with needles.
Many Giants are thus arrayed in a riot of colours, from sun-
bleached sailcloth, to brightly coloured Bretonnian barding._

_The bulk of Giants fight with a traditional club, though a
number prefer to squelch their meat with their bare hands.
Most Giants keep a sack, a barrel, or some other form of
container to stow their somewhat dubious “loot” in. Giants
are wildly unpredictable foes. Sometimes they lash about
with their tree-size clubs, while other times they’ll pick up
their smaller opponents and hurl them back into the fray.
Their ability to casually pick up and crush fully armoured
knights lingers long in the minds of those who’ve had to
fight them._

**Special Rules:**
* _Chaos Mutations (Chaos Giants only):_ Giants that
have thrown their lot in with the Ruinous Powers
will have one or more Mutations. Roll 1d10 
to determine the number of mutations: 1-5=1
mutation, 6-10=2 mutations.
* _Hideous Strength:_ All Giant attacks count as having
the Impact Quality.
* _Tipsy:_ Giants are frequently drunk and seldom
entirely stable on their feet. This leads to them
falling over at unexpected moments. Whenever a
Giant charges or takes more than 5 Wounds in a
single hit, he must make an Agility Test. Failure
means the Giant falls over and suffers 2 Wounds,
regardless of Toughness Bonus or armour. Anyone
fighting the Giant in melee combat must make a
successful Challenging (-10%) Agility Test or suffer
a Damage 7 hit from the falling Giant.
