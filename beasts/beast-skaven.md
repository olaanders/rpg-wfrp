# Skaven/Råttman

_The Skaven are a race of mutated Ratmen who plot in
the dark halls of their vast under-empire to one day rise
up to make war on the surface world and overthrow all
the kingdoms of Men. Often considered to be a form of
Beastmen, the Skaven are thought to have evolved from rats
too long exposed to the flesh twisting effects of the sinister
material known as Warpstone. Skaven generally have wiry
builds more given to speed than strength. They vary wildly
in height with the smallest standing just shy of four feet
tall and the largest well over six, though their cramped
underground dwellings make them prone to stooping. Their
fur is frequently coloured either brown or piebald, though
larger Skaven often have black fur, and white fur is seen as a
sign of their God’s favour._

## Clanrats/Klanråttor
 
_The bulk of the Skaven are members are one of the Warlord
Clans, such as Mors, Rictus, and Scruten. These most
common of Skaven are known as Clanrats and they provide
endless legions for the Lords of Decay._

> Skaven Magic: The most potent Skaven spellcasters are the Grey Seers. These
insidious sorcerers are powerful leaders in Skaven society. Until
Skaven magic can be dealt with in detail, you can simulate
Grey Seers with the various Wizard careers. Use the Arcane
Lore (Chaos) Talent but substitute lightning bolt for summon
lesser daemon and lightning storm for summon daemon pack.

> Grey Seers can add to their Casting Rolls by consuming
Warpstone tokens. Each token consumed gives a +3 to
their next Casting Roll, though use of raw Warpstone
increases the danger of Tzeentch’s Curse. Treat doubles on
Casting Rolls as triples and triples as quadruples. Grey Seers
generally carry 1d10 Warpstone tokens.
