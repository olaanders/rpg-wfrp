# Spirit/Andeväsen

_The dead do not rest easy in the Old World. The various
Spirits of the dead often return to haunt the lands of the
living. Some seek only release, while others hate the living
with such passion that they give themselves over to evil._

<br/>

## Ghost/Spöke

_Unless somehow coerced by powerful evil forces, Ghosts
are not usually malevolent. Some may be mischievous and
enjoy scaring the living. Most, however, wish only to be
released from their tormented existence. A Ghost may seek
to enlist the aid of the living to perform this release; perhaps
by ensuring its body is reburied on consecrated ground, or
by bringing its murderer to justice._

**Skills:** Concealment +20%, Gossip, Perception +20%,
Speak Language (any one)

**Talents:** Ethereal, Frightening, Night Vision, Undead

**Special Rules:**
* _Fearful Touch:_ The touch of a Ghost does not inflict
any damage to non-ethereal creatures, but does
cause the target to make a new Fear Test. This can
be dodged but not parried. Ghosts must become
visible for the round to use this ability.
* _Invisible:_ A Ghost can become invisible as a free
action. While invisible, a Ghost can’t be targeted
with ranged attacks, including magic missiles.
Because they are ethereal and silent, they also can’t
be attacked in melee.
* _Place of Death:_ A typical Ghost cannot move more
than 36 yards from its place of death without
necromantic compulsion. Certain Ghosts may
manage to wander much further. A Ghost whose
body has been physically removed from its place of
death, for example, might be capable of haunting
the current whereabouts of its body.

## Poltergeist

_Poltergeists are similar to Ghosts, but they love to frighten
mortals and play tricks on them. Why some of the dead
become Ghosts and others Poltergeists is a subject of debate._

## Spectre/Vålnad

_Spectres are Spirits trapped in the mortal world as a result of
a broken vow or a curse placed upon them. A few Spectres
may make common cause with the living in the hopes
relieving their condition and gaining freedom at last. The
majority, though, have been driven mad, evil, or both by
their years of torment and the knowledge that they helped
bring it upon themselves. They attack the living out of pure
malice, reaching their hands out from within walls or other
objects to paralyze and slowly kill anyone that falls into
their clutches._

|**A**|**W**|**SB**|**TB**|**M**|**Mag**|**IP**|**FP**|
|2|20|4|4|6|0|0|0|

**Skills:** Concealment +20%, Perception +20%, Speak
Language (any one)

**Talents:** Ethereal, Frightening, Night Vision, Undead

**Special Rules:**
* _Chilling Touch:_ Unlike most Spirits, a Spectre can
injure an opponent with its touch alone. This is a
Damage 4 attack that ignores all Armour Points;
it can be dodged but not parried. Furthermore, a
Spectre that hits its opponent also paralyzes him
with horror for 1 round unless a successful Will
Power Test is made. This paralysis effect applies
whether or not the Spectre’s touch inflicts any
damage. Paralyzed characters can take no actions
and are considered to be helpless. A Spectre must
become visible for the round to use this ability.
* _Invisible:_ See Ghost for rules.
* _Terrifying Display:_ A visible Spectre can put on a
terrifying display as a full action. The Spectre is
surrounded by a glowing nimbus and it radiates
malice as it cackles madly. Those seeing this must
immediately take a Terror Test.
