# Treeman/Trädman

_Treemen are massive humanoid creatures that resemble
upright walking trees. They are considered a legend by most
Old Worlders and the few that believe in their existence
think them long dead. They are not gone, but those that
remain dwell exclusively within the forest of Athel Loren.
Indeed, there are those who believe the Treemen are Athel
Loren. They seldom venture beyond the forest for any
but the direst reasons, and Dryads frequently accompany
them when they do so. The Treemen are wise and will not
engage in battles they cannot win unless they have no other
choice. All the creatures of Athel Loren obey them without
question, which grants them a great many beast allies, to say
nothing of the Wood Elves. To stand against the wrath of a
Treeman is to face the fury of nature unleashed. Survivors
often dread going into the woods for years afterward, many
of them becoming city dwellers permanently._
