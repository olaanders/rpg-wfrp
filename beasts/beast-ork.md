# Ork/Orch

_Orcs are an all-too-familiar sight to many ordinary folk
 throughout much of the Old World, especially to the
 south where Orc and other Greenskin tribes raid out of the
 Badlands on a regular basis._
 
 _The typical Orc soldier is no taller than an adult Human,
 but part of the reason for this is that the Orc never stands as
 straight as a Human; certainly, the Orc will have up to twice
 the mass of the man, much of it in the form of compact
 muscle and strong bone. Orc skin comes in various shades of
 green, from pale off-white greens all the way to the greenish-
 black hues of the Black Orcs. Their faces look somewhere
 between an ugly Human’s and a hairless boar’s, with short but
 pointed ears, low foreheads, heavy brows, small eyes and huge
 tusk-filled mouths. It is perhaps no coincidence that the Orc
 mount of choice is the Wild Boar._
 
 ## Black Orc/Svartorch
 
_Black Orcs are the biggest and strongest of all the Orc
 breeds and because of this they often provide the leadership
 for Orc tribes. Black Orcs are not necessarily any more
 intelligent than any other Orcs, but they are almost
 invariably more determined. It is said they fought their
 way out from under the whips of the Chaos Dwarfs many
 centuries ago, though bringing up that subject with them is,
 essentially, suicide. They are darker-skinned than other Orcs
 and even more massively muscled. They brook no failure
 from any of their subordinates and live only to make war._

**Special Rules:**
* _Quell Animosity:_ Black Orcs do not squabble
amongst themselves, nor do they brook such
infighting among Greenskins they command. A
Black Orc may quell any such infighting among
Greenskins within 12 yards with a successful
Routine (+10%) Command Test.
* _Choppas:_ See Common Orc for rules.

**Armour:** Heavy Armour (Breastplate, Full Mail Armour,
Helmet)

**Armour Points:** Head 5, Arms 3, Body 5, Legs 3

**Weapons:** Choppa, Hand Weapon or Great Weapon, Shield

**Slaughter Margin:** Challenging

## Common Orc/Orch
_Black Orcs are few in number, so it is the Common Orcs that
 make up the bulk of the Orc tribes. Usually known simply as
 Orcs, Common Orcs are brutes through and through. They
 bully the lesser Greenskins and delight in exerting power over
 those weaker than themselves. If a strong leader lops off a few
 heads, however, they quickly fall into line._

**Talents:** Menacing, Night Vision, Street Fighting, Strike
Mighty Blow

**Special Rules:**
* _Animosity:_ Orcs hate everything, even other Orcs
and Goblins. Given half a chance, given even
the merest shadow of an excuse, Orcs will fight
amongst themselves—battling a rival Orc tribe if
they are present, or battering other members of
their own tribe in unseemly squabbles if that is all
that is available. An Orc offered any kind of excuse
must make a Willpower Test or immediately attack
the other Greenskins, be they Goblins, Hobgoblins,
or other Orcs.
* _Choppas:_ Whatever an Orc’s other equipment, he
will always have a Choppa. An Orc Choppa is a
huge heavy blade, far too ungainly for a typical
human to wield in one hand but capable of inflicting
horrendous wounds. When wielded by an Orc, a
Choppa inflicts SB+1 damage on the first round
of melee and SB damage thereafter. If wielded by a
creature other than an Orc, a Choppa is treated as a
Hand Weapon but with the Slow quality.

**Armour:** Medium Armour (Chain Shirt, Leather Jack,
Leather Skullcap)

**Armour Points:** Head 1, Arms 1, Body 3, Legs 0

**Weapons:** Choppa, Dagger or Bow, Shield

**Slaughter Margin:** Average

## Savage Orc/Vildorch

_Savage Orcs are primitive Orcs that have given themselves over
entirely to superstition and the worship of the Gods Gork and
Mork. They paint themselves with strange and fanciful designs
that they believe grant them mystical power. Savage Orcs will
launch a pre-battle volley of arrows at their foes designed to
demonstrate Orc prowess, before wading in for the main event
with their choppas so they can prove their courage before
the rest of their tribe and the watchful eyes of the twin Orc
Gods. Savage Orcs disdain the use of armour, regarding it as
uncomfortable and unpleasantly stifling. They trust in their
lucky charms and warpaint for protection instead._

**Special Rules:**
* _Animosity:_ See Common Orc for rules.
* _Choppas:_ See Common Orc for rules.
* _Warpaint:_ Savage Orcs often paint themselves with
magical designs and wear primitive lucky charms
(including body parts from slain enemies). They
believe this to be pleasing to Gork and Mork and
that the gaze of these Gods will protect them in
battle. If in full warpaint, a Savage Orc’s Toughness
Bonus is treated as though it were increased by +2.
