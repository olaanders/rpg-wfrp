# Daemonette of Slaanesh/Demonett av Slaanesh

_Slaanesh’s most potent symbols of seduction and languor
 are the Daemonettes. They resemble beautiful Human
 women, but have horny ridges instead of hair and scythe-like
 talons instead of hands. A Daemonette is an alluring killer._
 
 _Whenever possible she will start a fight by negotiating—or
 rather, by seducing. If a potential opponent is willing to listen
 to her seductive whispers and murmurs, she will offer him
 pleasures undreamt of by mortals, lulling him with her words
 until she is close enough to indulge in her own favourite
 pleasure: impaling a victim on her razor sharp limbs. To a
 Daemonette’s twisted sensibilities, this is the perfect mingling
 of an almost erotic ecstasy with the equally delicious sensation
 of inflicting a painful death on the other party._

**Special Rules:**
* _Aura of Slaanesh_. A Daemonette is so seductive and
bewildering that living opponents within 4 yards (2
squares) suffer a –10% penalty to their Weapon Skill
and Will Power Characteristics
* Chaos Mutations: Animalistic Legs, Pincer Hand.
There is a 50% chance of an additional mutation
* _Instability_. Daemons are not so solidly linked to
the Old World as are mortals, and may sometimes
be forced back from whence they came if a battle
goes against them. On any round in which a
Daemonette is injured in melee combat but fails to
inflict any Wounds in return, it must succeed at a
Will Power Test or be banished back to the Realm
of Chaos from which it came.
