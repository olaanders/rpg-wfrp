# Giant Spider/Jättespindel

_Closely resembling ordinary spiders, but with a body the
 length of a man’s and unnaturally long legs, Giant Spiders
 are horrifically mutated versions of their lesser counterparts,
 swollen to a monstrous size by the forces of Chaos. Their
 heads are surmounted by up to eight large eyes and an even
 larger pair of mandibles. Their bodies are black or brown,
 sometimes with other, more brightly coloured markings,
 and their hairy brown legs move almost too fast to be seen.
 Giant Spiders prefer a stealthy approach, leaping down on
 top of a victim and filling him full of poison before he can
 react. Most Giant Spider attacks come when the creatures
 hunt for food, so they will often pick up and carry off an
 incapacitated victim rather than wait around to fight some
 more._

**Special Rules:**
* _Armoured Skin:_ The chitinous exterior of the Giant
Spider provides 2 Armour Points on all locations.

but the poison is intended to paralyze prey for later
consumption rather than kill. A target bitten by
a Giant Spider must make a Toughness Test or be
paralyzed for 1d10 rounds. Paralyzed characters can
take no actions and are considered to be helpless.
* _Wall Climbing:_ Giant Spiders can clamber up and
down walls with their sticky feet, just like normal
spiders. They can climb walls at their normal
movement rate.
