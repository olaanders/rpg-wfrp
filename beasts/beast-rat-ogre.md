# Rat Ogre/Råttrese

_The pinnacle of the Skaven Clan Moulder’s debased “art,”
 Rat Ogres are lethal beasts, unnaturally bred up from a
 variety of creatures using a combination of Warpstone
 and carefully applied insanity. Each one is subjected to a
 long series of “experiments” intended to encourage traits
 that their creators favour, such as overwhelming bloodlust
 and mindless ferocity. Many of them may indeed have
 Ogre blood in their long and varied ancestry, though none
 but the eldest Master Mutators could say. They generally
 appear to be massively over muscled Skaven, standing ten
 feet tall at the shoulder, though many of them are grossly
 misshapen, and/or have a variety of grafts, both metal and
 flesh fused to their bodies. Rat Ogres exist to kill. They
 aren’t the cleverest combatants, but their great strength and
 ability to withstand punishment frequently make up for
 that failing._

**Special Rules:**
* _In Need of Direction:_ Rat Ogres have been
systematically bred for a single purpose: fighting
at the command of a Clan Moulder handler.
Without a clear set of orders, or a commanding
Skaven to lead them, they will mill about
uncertainly. Rat Ogres will attack and attempt
to kill anything that harms them, but their
behaviour otherwise is highly erratic if they’ve lost
their handler or finished following their last order.
A Rat Ogre that wishes to engage in any other sort
of behaviour other than standing around drooling
must make a Will Power Test or stare aimlessly at
nothing.
