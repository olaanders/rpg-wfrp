# Wild Boar/Vildsvin

_The boars of the Old World are exceptionally ill-tempered and
vicious beasts, two traits that the Orcs admire greatly, which
is probably why so many have been taken as mounts for the
Greenskin hordes. The impact that a charging boar can produce
is considerable. Left to their own devices, boars generally root
the ground for grubs and menace any creatures foolish enough
to interrupt their feeding. Many boars have become entirely
carnivorous as a result of the Orcs breeding the trait into their
mounts, and then releasing them to mate with other wild boars._
