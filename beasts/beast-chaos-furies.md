# Chaos Fury/Kaos Furier

_The Furies are savage-looking winged Daemons associated
 with no one Chaos God in particular. They carry no
 weapons, but their claws and fangs are long and sharp.
 Chaos Furies almost always work in packs, being somewhat
 cowardly at heart. A pack of them in action is reminiscent of
 a flying school of piranhas, tearing a luckless victim to pieces.
 Chaos Furies prefer to attack the weak. They enjoy their
 time in the Old World, with the incredible variety and taste
 of the prey they can catch, and have no wish to shorten that
 time by hunting something larger, more numerous, or more
 ferocious than themselves. Their ideal targets are wounded,
 sleeping, alone, or small opponents. If faced with concerted
 opposition, they will flee rather than risk becoming unstable._

Old World as are mortals, and may sometimes be
forced back from whence they came if a battle goes
against them. On any round in which a Chaos Fury

Wounds in return, it must succeed at a Will Power

from which it came.
