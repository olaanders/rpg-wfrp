# Werecreature/Hamnskiftare

_Werecreatures can change their form into that of a beast.
The Weres of the North are Chaos tainted, whereas the
legendary Children of Ulric, if they exist, reputedly draw
their power from another source.
In Human form, Werecreatures, regardless of their origin,
have a normal profile (generated as a Player Character,
but without Fate Points). When they take on their second
form, their stat line and abilities are changed in different
ways, depending on what sort of Werecreature they are.
Note that the following stat lines either modify or replace
a Werecreature’s original Human stat line when they are
“berserk”. Changing forms is a full action._
