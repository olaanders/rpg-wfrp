# Giant Rat/Jätteråtta

_Giant Rats are oversized rodents that dwell in the sewers
of the Empire’s larger cities, amongst other places. The vile
Ratmen use them as cheap and expendable shock troops.
Giant Rats typically travel in groups of ten or more and
prefer to swarm over their prey in large numbers. A solitary
Giant Rat is far more likely to flee than fight, unless he
believes his prey wounded or incapable of fighting back._
