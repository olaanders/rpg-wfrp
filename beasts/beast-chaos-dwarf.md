# Chaos Dwarfs/KaosdvÃ¤rgar

_Twisted and resentful of their brethren, they seek to blot out the light of the sun, eclipsing the entire world in the 
blackness favoured by their new patron, Hashut, the Father of Darkness. They know little of mercy or compassion, 
enslaving all other races that they encounter, save their occasional servants, the Hobgoblins. Chaos Dwarfs prefer to 
let others do their fighting for them but their finely crafted weapons and stout armour serve them well when battle calls._

volcanic energy.

can simulate such sorcerers with the various Wizard careers

Lore of Fire, but they use lava and ash in addition to flames.
