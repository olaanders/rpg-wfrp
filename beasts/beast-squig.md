# Squig/Krumelbest

_Squigs are bulbous round things with tiny eyes, huge
mouths and fangs, and short but thickly muscled legs
terminating in claws. They come in an enormous variety
of colours and shapes and no two of them are exactly alike.
Squigs are barely more intelligent than mushrooms. Night
Goblins use them as both mounts and food._
