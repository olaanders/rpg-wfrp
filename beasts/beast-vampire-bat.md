# Vampire Bat/Vampyrfladdermus

_Vampire Bats closely resemble more normal bats in general
outline, but they are far larger, with wingspans of up to
fifteen feet and bodies the size of large dogs. A Vampire Bat
is further distinguished from a mere bat by its obviously
Undead nature. Although its body is usually in far better
condition than a Zombie or other lesser Undead, its pallid
skin and red-glowing eyes are a clear warning to anyone
who sees it._

_Vampire Bats typically hunt alone, in which case they
will seek out small groups of travellers or better still lone
merchants and wanderers. Rarely, several Vampire Bats
may hunt together, or be recruited into the army of a
necromancer or Vampire Lord. In this case they will attack
more openly, but otherwise with variants of their usual
tactics—either overwhelming a group who have inferior
numbers, or else carrying off victims._
