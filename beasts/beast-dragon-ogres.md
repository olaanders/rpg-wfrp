# Dragon Ogre/Drakrese
_Dragon Ogres are large centaur-like beings with the lower
quarters of a four-legged scaled beast and an upper body
that closely resembles a well-muscled Ogre, hence their
traditional name. They refer to their own race as Shartaks.
The Beastmen and cultists of the Dark Gods call them
by a variety of other names as well, for they play a part in
many legends of those who follow Chaos. Dragon Ogres
slumber in deep caves throughout the northern reaches of
the Worldâ€™s Edge Mountains, awakened only by the thunder
caused by the largest storms. They believe that the thunder
is the Chaos Gods summoning them to war and according
to their ancient pact those that are awakened by a storm rise
and prepare for battle. Electricity invigorates the Dragon
Ogres and upon rising they climb to lofty heights where
they struggle against their brethren to see who will have the
highest peak from which to absorb lightning strikes. As fierce
as they are, Dragon Ogres are loath to lay down their ancient
lives and will retreat if a battle is going against them._
