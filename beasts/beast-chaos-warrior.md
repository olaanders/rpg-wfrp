# Chaos Warrior/Kaoskrigare

_A Chaos Warrior utterly embraces the power of darkness,
 dedicating his mind, body, and soul to the Ruinous Powers.
 Chaos Warriors are terrible foes, having abandoned their
 humanity for the temptations of the Chaos Gods._

> Chaos Armour: Chaos Armour is worn by particularly powerful Chaos Warriors. It is a dark gift from the Ruinous Powers, and melds
permanently with the wearer’s body, infusing him with the power of Chaos. It is heavy armour and provides 5 Armour
Points like Full Plate Armour, but since it becomes part of the wearer’s body it is much less encumbering (Enc. 250).
Additionally, a warrior so protected reduces the Critical Value of any Critical Hits suffered by 1. Chaos spellcasters can cast
spells in such armour without penalty.
