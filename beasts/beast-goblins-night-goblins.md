# Goblin and Night Goblin/Vätte och Nattvätte

_Goblins are short, green-skinned humanoids that rarely
 exceed four feet in height. They are vicious, quarrelsome,
 and disorganized. Goblin tribes live deep in the forests
 of the Empire, often under the heel of their powerful
 Orc kin. When not controlled by strong leaders, goblins
 inevitably begin to squabble amongst themselves. This,
 and their penchant for running when battles turn against
 them, makes most Goblin threats ephemeral but their
 cruelty and wickedness ensures that Goblins remain the
 bogeymen of the peasantry._
 
_Night Goblins are similar to their cousins, but live deep
 underground in the World’s Edge Mountains. They often
 lair near Squig caves, since they use Squigs in battle and
 also for food._

**Skills:** Common Knowledge (Greenskins), Concealment,
Outdoor Survival, Perception, Ride or Swim, Silent
Move, Scale Sheer Surface, Speak Language (Goblin
Tongue)

**Talents:** Night Vision

**Special Rules:**
* _Animosity:_ Goblins, like Orcs, are a fractious lot and
they need very little reason to squabble amongst
themselves or mix it up with other Greenskins. A
Goblin offered any kind of excuse must make a
Will Power Test or immediately attack the offending
Greenskins, be they Hobgoblins, Orcs, or other
Goblins.
* _Elveses is Scary:_ Goblins find Elves extremely
unnerving. Whether this is because of the ancient
animosity between the two races, or simply because
of the Elves’ superior mannerisms and smell of
cleanliness, a Goblin must make a Fear Test if it and
its allies do not outnumber the Elves present by at
least two to one.
* _Night Goblins:_ Night Goblins have the same stats as
regular Goblins with the following exceptions. They
have the Specialist Weapon Group (Entangling)
Talent and can have a net instead of a shield. They
hate Dwarfs so passionately that they gain a +5%
WS bonus when fighting them.
* _Night Goblin Fanatics:_ A Night Goblin Fanatic is an
ordinary Night Goblin who has decided to prove
himself (and possibly sacrifice himself) for the sake
of the tribe. A Fanatic will be given a dose of _Mad
Cap Mushrooms_ before battle, which is enough
to scramble his poor brain so much that he hurls
himself fanatically at any opposition, whirling round
in circles and swinging a heavy iron ball with all his
might. Fanatics have the Specialist Weapon Group
(Two-handed) Talent and the ball and chain counts
as a Great Weapon. The Mad Cap Mushrooms
increase the Fanatic’s Strength and Toughness by
10%. In his madness, he can’t dodge or parry. The
effects of this drug last for 2d10 rounds. At the end
of the effect, the mushrooms deal 2 Wounds to the
Fanatic, regardless of Toughness Bonus or armour.

**Armour:** Light Armour (Leather Jerkin)

**Armour Points:** Head 0, Arms 0, Body 1, Legs 0

**Weapons:** Hand Weapon, Short bow or Spear, Shield

**Slaughter Margin:** Easy (Routine for Night Goblin Fanatics)
