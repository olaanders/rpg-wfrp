# Zombie

_A Zombie is always Humanoid in form, being an animated
Human corpse in a greater or lesser state of decay.
Depending on its age, it may resemble anything from
an almost alive-looking, freshly killed corpse that is only
revealed as Undead by the gaping axe wound in its forehead,
all the way to Zombies so badly decayed as to resemble
little more than Skeletons, with only a few tatters of flesh
remaining._
