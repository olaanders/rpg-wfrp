# Minotaur

_Minotaur is the name given to a specific offshoot of
 Beastmen. They are massive bull-headed humanoids, rightly
 feared for the carnage they can cause on the battlefield.
 Their large horns are the envy of their smaller Beastman kin.
 Minotaurs have a near insatiable appetite for blood and are
 infamous for stopping in the midst of a battle to consume
 fallen foes, sometimes while they’re still alive._

Expanded Chaos Mutations to generate the extra
mutation if present and modify stats as appropriate.
* _Bloodgreed:_ Minotaurs have a disturbing habit
of consuming the bodies of those they’ve killed,
sometimes while combat is still in progress. If a
Minotaur slays an opponent and he isn’t engaged
in melee with anyone else, he must make a Routine
(+10%) Will Power Test or sit down to gorge
himself on the kill. He can test again at the start
of his turn each round until he passes the test. If
the Minotaur is attacked in melee, he snaps out of
Bloodgreed immediately.
