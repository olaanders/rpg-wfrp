# Ogre/Rese

_Ogres are big, ugly humanoids, with coarse features and
 an imposing presence. Ogres enjoy eating, fighting, and
 eating some more. While they may be brutal and can eat
 nearly anything, ogres are not evil per se. Since dumb
 muscle is welcome in almost any army, ogres can be
 found throughout the Old World. They make formidable
 mercenaries and bands of ogre sell-swords are a common
 sight in the Empire, Tilea, and the Border Princes. They
 have also been known to fight with Orcs, Goblins, and
 the forces of Chaos. Far to the northeast of the Empire
 are the Ogre Kingdoms, but few Imperial ogres have
 cause to go there._
