# Dryad/Trädnymf

_Dryads are beautiful, but dangerous, nature spirits that
inhabit the ancient forest of Athel Loren, and possibly others
in the Old World. They typically appear as beautiful Elf or
Human women, though their skin often has an inhuman
green or brown sheen to it. When fighting, they turn into
terrible snarling beings seemingly made of wood. They are
elusive opponents, mercurial in their actions and difficult
to read. Dryads have been known to sincerely compliment
a foe on a particularly telling blow, only to take his head off
moments later._

**Special Rules:**
* _Of Shifting Aspect:_ A Dryad is a natural shapeshifter.
In combat her body takes on the aspects of various
types of trees. For reasons unknown to other races,
save perhaps the Treemen, a Dryad cannot hold the
same aspect for more than one round at a time. At
the start of her turn each round, the Dryad must
choose a new aspect from among the following:
    * _Ash:_ +20% bonus to her Toughness Characteristic.
    * _Birch:_ +1 bonus to her Attacks Characteristic.
    * _Oak:_ +20% bonus to her Strength Characteristic.
    * _Willow:_ She may parry once as a free action any
    time before her next turn.
* _War Form:_ In battle a Dryad transforms into the
personification of the forest’s vengeance. The switch
to this war form can be made as a free action and
it grants the Dryad the Frightening Talent and 2
Armour Points on all locations.
