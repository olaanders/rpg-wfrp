# Wraith/Skuggvålnad

_Wraiths are tall, cloaked forms wielding huge scythes. The
only features visible beneath the cloak are their glowing
eyes, though some throw back their hoods to reveal the
ethereal likeness of an evilly grinning skull beneath.
Wraiths are formed when powerful wizards coming to
the end of their allotted years begin to experiment with
various methods of keeping themselves alive. Those who
succeed became necromancers, or perhaps occasionally
Vampires. Those who fail became Wraiths—living on in an
Undead form by virtue of their desperate desire to cheat
death._

_Wraiths are often quite intelligent, and will sometimes
use their Etherealness to ambush enemies. Often, though,
they prefer to simply attack; revelling in their sheer power
and in the terror they cause, swinging their scythes with
wild abandon, half-believing themselves to be truly the
incarnations of Death which they so resemble._
