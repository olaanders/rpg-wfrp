# Warhawk/Rock

_Warhawks are birds of prey large enough to serve as
flying mounts. Their wingspan measures over six yards
and each of their talons is as long as a dagger, making
them dangerous adversaries in their own right. They are
rarely seen in the Old World, and when spotted they are
invariably ridden by the Wood Elves of Athel Loren._
