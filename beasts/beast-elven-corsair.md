# Elven Corsair/Alvisk Korsar

_The corsairs refer to themselves as the Druchii and there may
be some truth to the stories of their exile from the land of
Ulthuan. Sailors that have faced them in battle and survived
claim that they resembled Elves, though of cruel aspect. They
are skilled warriors who revel in blood soaked close combat,
seemingly taking pleasure in their foes’ pain. They adorn
themselves in scaled cloaks capable of turning sword blows
and are well practiced in rapid boarding actions._

_While they prefer to take ships at sea, they will occasionally
sack port towns and coastal villages. Those they don’t kill
outright are dragged away in chains, never to be seen again.
Who they are and why they come seeking plunder is almost
entirely unknown in the Old World._
