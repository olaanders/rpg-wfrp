# Great Eagle/Stor Örn

_Great Eagles are the largest birds of prey in the Empire,
 with a wingspan that measures over thirty feet and having
 razor-sharp talons. They are an ancient race that has dwelled
 in the mountains of the Old World since long before the
 coming of Man. Most of them nest in the Grey Mountains,
 though a few live along the World’s Edge range. They are
 exceedingly intelligent and a few of their eldest are even
 rumoured to be capable of speaking in the tongues of
 other races, though they seem to prefer most often to deal
 with Elves. The vision of Great Eagles is so sharp that they
 can clearly watch the movements of ground animals from
 miles away. Correspondingly, they are capable of executing
 devastating ambushes wherein they attack an opponent
 from such a great height that their target isn’t aware of his
 danger till their claws sink into his flesh._
