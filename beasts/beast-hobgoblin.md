# Hobgoblin/Storvätte

_Hobgoblins are one of the Greenskin races. They are both
 stronger and taller than Goblins. Indeed, the largest among
 the Hobgoblin tribes are as tall as any Orc. Their builds,
 though, are lean and wiry, unlike the muscled bulk of the
 Orcs. Hobgoblins ride snarling Giant Wolves
 that they’ve specifically bred for speed and savagery. They are
 expert mounted archers, often practising for days on end at
 hitting small targets while riding past going full tilt. They
 prefer hit and run tactics to stand up fights, though they will
 attack if they outnumber their opponents by more than three
 to one._

**Special Rules:**
* _Animosity:_ Hobgoblins, like Orcs, are a fractious
lot and they need very little reason to squabble
amongst themselves or mix it up with other
Greenskins. A Hobgoblin offered any kind
of excuse must make a Will Power Test or
immediately attack the offending Greenskins, be
they Goblins, Orcs, or other Hobgoblins.
* _Poisoned Attacks:_ Hobgoblin skirmishers
frequently poison their weapons. They use a
mushroom derived poison called Kervalt. A
weapon coated with this poison that inflicts at
least 1 Wound deals 2 additional Wounds unless
the target succeeds at a Challenging (-10%)
Toughness Test.
