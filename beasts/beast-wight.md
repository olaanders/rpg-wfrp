# Wight/Högre odöd

_Wights are the remains of mortal heroes, animated beyond
death by their own evil wills, and by strong magic woven
by those who interred them in their grave-mounds many
centuries earlier. Wights are almost always arrayed in full
armour, but their pale faces are visible beneath the helm,
spectral remnants of their long-decayed bodies. Though
most have no flesh left, nothing but bones turned brown
from their long exposure to the soil, still their faces are set
in a grim and warlike frown.
The combination of armour and bones makes them very
resilient, but it also at least gives their enemies something
to aim for—these are not incorporeal, intangible monsters
like Spectres or Wraiths. Wights still have all their military
knowledge and experience available to them from when
they were alive, and many of them have been fighting for
centuries or even millennia when Undead, as well._
