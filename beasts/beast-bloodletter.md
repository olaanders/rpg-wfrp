# Bloodletter of Khorne

_Bloodletters of Khorne are tall, muscular humanoids, with
 snarling bestial faces and great curving horns. Their skin is
 deep red and runs constantly with thick blood that seems to
 ooze from every pore. Bloodletters always wield huge axes, and
 have various armoured metal plates attached to their very skin.
 Bloodletters exist only for war. They live to prove themselves
 in battle, or die in the attempt, which means little to them as
 they can simply return to fight another day when summoned
 once more._
