# Wyvern/Mörkerbest

_Wyverns resemble the descriptions of Dragons, but only
superficially. Those who have seen both would not mistake
one for the other—even apart from the different number
of limbs, a Wyvern’s body and head are shaped quite
differently from a Dragon’s, being less lithe and sinuous,
and more heavily muscled for its size. Wyverns rarely attack
Humans unless their mountain homes are disturbed. They
will swoop down and carry off large herd animals, but have
long since learned that Humans are not worth the effort
as prey unless the Wyverns are starving (not enough meat
on them, and too much chance they might be armed with
swords or spells)._

_A Wyvern that has been tamed for riding by an Orc
Warlord will be used in any manner the Orc can think of.
Before combat the Warlord may mount his Wyvern for
a scouting mission, trusting to what his own eyes can see
rather than believing his Goblin scouts. During battle, the
Wyvern is again used to oversee the situation, but can also
carry the Orc into the thick of the fighting whenever the
need arises._

* _Tail Attack:_ At the end of any round in which the

as a free action. This is resolved exactly like any
other natural attack of the Wyvern’s, except that
it is also poisoned. If the attack inflicts at least
1 Wound, the target loses 3 additional Wounds
unless a successful Challenging (-10%) Toughness
Test is made.
