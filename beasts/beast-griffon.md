# Griffon/Grip

_Griffons are fearsome beasts that have the heads of birds of prey
 combined with leonine bodies and massive feathered wings.
 Their beaks are hooked and can easily sever a man’s limb. Their
 claws, which are reminiscent of a hawk’s talons, they keep sharp
 by regular scoring against stone. Griffons swoop down on their
 prey, screaming war cries as they come. They continue to attack
 until no opponent is left moving. Survivors of Griffon attacks
 often have dreams of being hunted down and rent limb from
 limb for years afterward. These mighty predators dwell amidst
 the highest peaks of the World’s Edge Mountains, occasionally
 flying to the lowlands when food is scarce. A rare few serve as
 mounts for the richest and most powerful Imperial nobles, who
 are willing to pay vast sums of gold for a single egg or chick.
 Griffons are fierce and wild creatures, never entirely tame, no
 matter how many years of domestication they’ve endured._
