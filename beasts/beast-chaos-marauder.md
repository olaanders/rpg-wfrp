# Chaos Marauders/Kaosvilde

_Chaos Marauders come from the Human tribes of the far
 North. For those who grow up close to the Chaos Wastes,
 there is little distinction made between a warrior who has
 been warped by Chaos, and any other fighter, save that the
 Chaos-tainted one is likely to be more powerful and thus
 favoured by the Gods._
