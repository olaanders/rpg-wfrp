# Mummy/Mumie

_Mummies are made from the corpses of ancient warriors
 that were wrapped in funeral linens and embalmed to
 prevent decay. Many of the oldest civilizations of Humans,
 most notably those of Araby and the great southern empire
 of Nehekhara, interred their dead in such fashion. With
 the rise of the Great Necromancer Nagash and his cursed
 art, many of these preserved dead were disturbed from
 their rest and animated. Unlike the more mindless Undead,
 such as Skeletons and Zombies, Mummies always have a
 will of their own. Indeed, their will is so strong they can
 command lesser forms of Undead to do their bidding. The
 few Mummies that dwell in the Empire are content to lie
 still in their sarcophagi until something disturbs their rest.
 They swiftly crush anything that stirs them from their sleep
 before returning to their tomb. There are a few, though, that
 retain the agendas they had in life, which can make them
 terrible foes. They are usually armed as they were in life.
 Weapons and armour that have survived untarnished down
 the long ages with a Mummy are doubtless magical._

**Special Rules:**
* _Ancient Will:_ Only individuals with iron hard wills
return to the world as a Mummy. They cannot be
controlled as other Undead. Indeed, their will is such
that lesser Undead, such as Skeletons and Zombies,
obey them and they can control Undead just like a
necromancer (see WFRP, page 161). Mummies will
almost always be encountered with a dozen or more
Skeleton warriors at their beck and call.
* _Flammable:_ Ancient wrappings and embalming
fluids make Mummies quite flammable. When a
Mummy is hit with a fire-based attack, any Wounds
suffered are doubled. This is calculated after any
deductions for Toughness Bonus or armour.
