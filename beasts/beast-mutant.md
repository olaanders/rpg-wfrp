# Mutant

_Mutants include those born with Chaos mutations, as well
 as those that develop them later in life. Mutants range from
 individuals desperate to belong to the rest of society who
 conceal their deformity to the best of their ability, to those
 that embrace Chaos completely, join a cult, and turn all
 their efforts to overthrowing the Empire. Regardless of their
 intentions, many Mutants try to live as Humans, if their
 mutations will permit it. If not, they are only alive because
 they either fled from the authorities or they were abandoned
 in the woods as children and the life of an outcast is the only
 one they’ve ever known. Some, particularly those with the
 Bestial Appearance mutation, may be adopted by Beastmen
 warbands. The following stats represent a “typical” Mutant,
 but in the end, there are no standard Mutants._
