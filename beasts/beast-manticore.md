# Manticore/Mantikora

_Manticores are ferocious beasts that dwell high in the
 mountains, usually far from the habitations of Humanity.
 Few have ever been seen in the Empire, which is doubtless
 a blessing, for they are voracious predators who constantly
 hunt not only for sustenance, but also for the pleasure of
 the kill. The common description of a Manticore depicts
 them with the body of a large lion, surmounted by a pair of
 leathery bat wings and a whip-like tail. But they are a Chaos
 breed, mutable and terrible with uncountable variations.
 Some have barbed tails like a scorpionâ€™s that bear bitter
 poison. Others are armoured in scales and covered in thorny
 projections that bleed ceaselessly. Manticores are cunning
 fighters. They are swift to retreat to the relative safety of the
 air when a battle goes against them._
