# Horrors of Tzeentch/Tzeentchs Fasor

_The Horrors of Tzeentch have an ever-shifting appearance,
 always horrifying, but never the same from one moment to
 the next. They are living embodiments of magic and change,
 and they become more powerful in large groups. Such Daemon 
 packs can inflict terrible mutations on their foes and 
 even transform them into more Horrors of Tzeentch._

**Special Rules:**
* _Chaos Mutations._ Claws. There is a 75% chance
of an additional mutation.
* _Living Magic._ In a very real sense, Horrors are
magical energy given shape and sentience by their
Lord. Their bodies continually give off energy
that they are capable of directing in a manner
reminiscent of spell casting. In fact, as they gather
in numbers, their Magic Characteristics grow
proportionally. A single Horror has a Magic Characteristic 
of 1. In a group of three to eight, each has a Magic
Characteristic of 2. In groups of nine members or
more, each has a Magic Characteristics of 3. Horrors
can direct their energies towards casting the two spells
noted in the _Horror Magic_ sidebar. Note that Horrors
are subject to Tzeentch’s Curse, but the effects are
spectacularly different. If a Horror gets a double or
triple on a Casting Roll, a random Horror from the
group explodes with a mad cackle of laughter and the
spell is successfully cast, regardless of the Casting Roll.
* Instability: Daemons are not so solidly linked to the
Old World as are mortals, and may sometimes be
forced back from whence they came if a battle goes
against them. On any round in which a Horror of
Tzeentch is injured in melee combat but fails to
inflict any Wounds in return, it must succeed at a
Will Power Test or be banished back to the Realm
of Chaos from which it came.

## Horror Magic

These two new spells can be cast by Horrors of Tzeentch only.

|Tzeentch’s Fire|
|---------------|
|_Casting Number:_ 6|
|_Casting Time:_ Half Action|
|_Ingredient:_ None|
|_Description:_ The Horror hurls a ball of shimmering pink and blue fire at one opponent within 48 yards (24 squares). This is a magic missile with Damage 4. Anyone struck by Tzeentch’s fire must also make a Will Power Test or be stunned for 1 round as the magic courses through them.|

|Uncontrollable Mutation|
|-----------------------|
|_Casting Number:_ 18|
|_Casting Time:_ Full Action|
|_Description:_ The merest touch of the Horror causes an opponent’s body to rend itself apart. This inflicts 1d10 Wounds, regardless of Toughness Bonus or armour. If the target is slain, a new Horror immediately erupts from the victim’s body. It can act normally on the following round. If the target was wounded but not slain, he must make a Will Power Test or gain a mutation as per the touch of Chaos spell. Uncontrollable mutation is a touch spell.|
