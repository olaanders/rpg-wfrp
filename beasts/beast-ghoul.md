# Ghouls/Likätare

_Ghouls closely resemble crooked, skinny, misshapen
Humans with feral eyes. They are believed to file their
teeth, and so have upper and lower rows of triangular
cutting fangs, perfect for biting and tearing flesh. More
feared still are their claws. Their hands and fingers have
stiffened and hardened, their fingernails growing into
great tough talons, which constantly secrete viscous black
venom. Ghouls have a certain low animal cunning, but
this is constantly at war with their near-eternal hunger for
flesh._

_The sophistication of their tactics depends entirely
on whether the drive for survival or for meat is uppermost
in their minds at the time. Against a superior foe, they
will likely hang back and harass the enemy, perhaps even
following a party as they travel through the wilderness of
Sylvania, waiting for one of them to lag behind or for the
group to be attacked by others. Sooner or later, however,
they tire of their waiting game—perhaps not realizing
that they could win, if they only stuck it out long enough,
for all things must die eventually. Once their blood is
up, once the hunger has taken over every other drive,
the Ghouls will charge in a growling, slavering mass, not
stopping until they have a surfeit of flesh to eat._
