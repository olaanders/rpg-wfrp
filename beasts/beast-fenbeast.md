# Fenbeast/Träskbest

_Fenbeasts are large sorcerous constructs assembled from
material gathered from marshes and swamps where many
have died in battle. They are unnatural creatures that
reek of stagnant marshes and have the touch of the grave
about them. The presence of a Fenbeast often indicates the
presence of a necromancer or other kind of spell caster,
often one with grim intentions. Fenbeasts, being all but
devoid of will, are not imaginative opponents, but this can
change with a skilled handler._
