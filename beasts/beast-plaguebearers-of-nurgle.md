# Plaguebearers of Nurgle/Nurgles Pestbärare

_Plaguebearers of Nurgle appear rather like horrendously
 diseased and mutated Humans. Their bellies are distended
 and swollen, often splitting open in great pus-oozing wounds
 to reveal the bloated and cankerous organs within. Their
 limbs are stick-thin and curved as though from starvation.
 Atop this monstrous frame perches a twisted, one-eyed visage,
 its fanged maw chanting a gruesome catalogue of diseases to
 itself. Fighting a Plaguebearer is a truly disgusting experience
 and involves considerable risk of disease._

**Special Rules:**
* _Chaos Mutations._ Claws. There is a 50% chance
of an additional mutation.
* _Cloud of Flies._ A Plaguebearer is constantly surrounded
by a cloud of flies and assorted biting and stinging
insects that swarm over anyone who comes near the
Daemon. Melee opponents of the Plaguebearer suffer
a –10% penalty to their Weapon Skill.
* _Instability._ Daemons are not so solidly linked to
the Old World as are mortals, and may sometimes
be forced back from whence they came if a battle
goes against them. On any round in which a
Plaguebearer is injured in melee combat but fails
to inflict any Wounds in return, it must succeed
at a Will Power Test or be banished back to the
Realm of Chaos from which it came.
* _Plague._ Opponents that survive an encounter
with a Plaguebearer may still be undone. Any
character that suffered at least 1 Wound from a
Plaguebearer must make a Toughness Test at the
end of the combat or contract a disease of the
GM’s choice.
* _Stream of Corruption._ Once every other round, a
Plaguebearer can vomit a stream of corruption at
one melee opponent as a full action. This disgusting
mixture of entrails, maggots, and filth hits
automatically for Damage 3. It may be dodged but
not parried (for obvious reasons). Anyone struck by
this attack must make a Toughness Test or contract
a disease of the GM’s choice.
