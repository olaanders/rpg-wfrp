# Skeleton/Skelett

_Skeletons are created when necromancers violate graveyards
and reanimate the bones of the dead. They are mindless
creatures that need to be controlled by magic lest they
return to their eternal slumber. While they have no
intelligence, they do not need to eat or rest and they never
retreat or surrender._
