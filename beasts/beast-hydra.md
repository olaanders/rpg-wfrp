# Hydra

_Hydras are fierce, disturbing creatures whose unnatural
 appearance can permanently unhinge foes, causing them
 to recoil from snakes for years afterward. They are wholly
 unnatural reptilian monsters, from their multiple heads
 to their capacity to breathe fire. A Hydra’s heads resemble
 those of a Dragon, though their snouts usually end in
 sharp beaks more reminiscent of a bird of prey. They
 typically have five heads, though the number varies by the
 beast. Hydras that have lost one of their heads to battle
 or misfortune can often regenerate it, though the process
 can take years. However, they seem to function just as
 readily with missing heads. Hydras are dangerous foes,
 but not particularly intelligent combatants. They generally
 breathe fire once, and then wade into melee. They are easily
 distracted and sometimes just cease fighting and walk away
 for no apparent reason._
