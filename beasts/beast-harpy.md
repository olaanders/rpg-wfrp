# Harpy/Harpya

_Harpies are rare winged predators almost entirely unknown
 in the Old World. They make their lairs in the mountains
 and cliffs of the Land of Chill but always near the sea, where
 prey is more readily available. Their wings are leathery,
 resembling those of a bat, though their forms often sprout
 black feathers. Their lower bodies end in scale-covered birdâ€™s
 legs and jagged talons. It is their torsos that likely cause
 such speculation about Harpies, for they have the upper
 body of a voluptuous female, though with a savage and feral
 beauty. Their appearance has lead to many arguments among
 scholars; some concluding that they are little more than mere
 beasts, others that they are touched by Chaos. Harpies will
 frequently try to attack from surprise and in large numbers.
 They put their wings to good advantage, using hit and run
 tactics on land bound foes. They will swiftly retreat to a high
 location where they cannot be readily followed if injured._
