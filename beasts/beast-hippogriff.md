# Hippogriff/Hippogryf

_Hippogriffs are fiercely carnivorous beasts that live high in
 the Grey Mountains. They compete with Pegasi for eyrie
 space, though they wisely leave the Great Eagles alone. A
 small number of Bretonnian knights use them as mounts.
 Hippogriffs have the head and winged feathers of a bird of
 prey, the forequarters of a mountain lion and the rear end of
 a horse, complete with tail. Their unusual appearance speaks
 to their Chaotic origins. Hippogriffs’ desire for warm flesh
 is so great that those around them can literally sense their
 terrible hunger. Survivors of a Hippogriff’s attack often keep
 a sharp lookout skywards for years afterwards._
