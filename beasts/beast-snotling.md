# Snotling

_Snotlings closely resemble Goblins, but are noticeably
smaller than their cousins. They are green in colour, with
small but sharply pointed teeth, little piggy eyes, spindly
limbs, pointy ears, and long noses. They are, quite possibly,
the most pathetic sentient race imaginable. It’s definitely a
compliment to even think of them as “sentient.”_

_Snotlings bundle together into Snotling Swarms when
attacked. All the Snotlings in an area will bunch up
together, rather than attempting to attack from different
angles, and simply swarm all over an opponent. They are so
dim that they can’t even recognize when they are in danger._
