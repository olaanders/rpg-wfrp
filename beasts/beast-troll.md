# Troll

_Trolls are large, strong, and staggeringly dim. They come
in a variety of colours, from the weedy green of River
Trolls to the greys and blues of Stone Trolls. Judging from
their appearance and behaviour, they may or may not be big
cousins of the Greenskins._

_Trolls prefer to attack with their clubs or natural weapons,
but if need be they will “soften up” an armoured target with
a dose of vomit before laying in with the club. A group of
Trolls will work together reasonably well, concentrating
their devastating attacks against one or a small group of
targets, but only until the first enemy is dead. At that point
it is typical that at least one Troll will get distracted, starting
to eat the corpse, which often distracts the others and causes
a fight to break out as the Trolls squabble over the choicest
morsels of meat._

## Common Troll/Troll

_Unfortunately for the good citizens of the Old World,
Common Trolls can be found almost anywhere. They favour
particularly foul-smelling places, but for every Troll that
makes its home in a rotten swamp or stagnant poolside
there is likely to be another that has colonised a muck-
ridden stable or an abandoned house that still has rotten
food in the larder and dead cats decaying in the corners._

**Skills:** Intimidate, Perception, Scale Sheer Surface or Swim,
Speak Language (Goblin Tongue)

**Talents:** Fearless, Frightening, Natural Weapons, Night Vision,
Specialist Weapon Group (Two-handed)

**Special Rules:**
* _Regeneration:_ At the start of its turn each round, a
Troll regenerates 1d10 Wounds. Wounds caused
by fire cannot be regenerated. This ability ceases to
function if the Troll dies.
* _Stoopid:_ Trolls are quite stupid and they often forget
what they are doing. Any time a Troll encounters
something that might distract it, such as a fresh corpse
to eat or a particularly ripe smell to investigate, it must
make an Intelligence Test or stop whatever it was
previously doing to engage with the new distraction (in
the above examples, eat the corpse or investigate the
smell). If the Troll is being attacked, it is far less likely
to be distracted and the test becomes Easy (+20%).
* _Vomit:_ A Troll can vomit on a melee opponent as a full
action, spraying corrosive and ill-smelling digestive
juices whose foulness defies description. The vomit
attack hits automatically for Damage 5 and ignores all
Armour Points. It may be dodged but not parried (for
obvious reasons).

**Armour:** None

**Armour Points:** Head 0, Arms 0, Body 0, Legs 0

**Slaughter Margin:** Hard

## Chaos Troll/Kaostroll

_Chaos Trolls are even more fearsome, stench-laden, and
ugly than their normal counterparts. They are typically
mutated by their contact with Chaos, often barely
resembling a Common Troll other than in size and
savagery. Chaos Warlords recruit such Trolls whenever
possible. While they may be dim, their capacity for
destruction is impressive._

mutations. Then roll on Table 2-1: Expanded

as appropriate.

## River Troll/Flodtroll

_A River Troll somewhat resembles the bottom of the river,
if that riverbed is particularly coated in sediment, slime,
rotting vegetation, fish carcasses, and various other smelly
detritus whose precise nature and origin are too horrible to
contemplate. In all probability the River Troll’s stink is even
worse than that of the riverbed, since one can add the Troll’s
personal miasma to the ill-omened mélange of odours
emitted from the mucky smears on its skin._

**Special Rules:**
* _Regeneration:_ See Common Troll for rules.
* _Stink Baaaad:_ Due to the especially unpleasant stench
of a River Troll, any opponents in melee combat have
–10% penalty to WS, unless they have no sense of
smell or have some means of nullifying said sense.

## Stone Troll/Grottroll

_Stone Trolls live on rocky mountains and tend to consume large
quantities of stone and rock. The natural magical inertia of
stone imbues them with a certain degree of magical resistance._
