# Vampire/Vampyr

_Vampires are ancient and powerful Undead, who sprang
from dark researches conducted in the Nehekharan city of
Khemri by the Priest King Nagash. Nagash experimented
with advanced mummification techniques and Necromantic
magic on his own body, prolonging his life enormously.
After Nagash’s defeat, the Queen of Lahmia acquired his
research materials and was able to complete a version of
his great work, transforming herself and her closest allies
into Vampires. Eventually the Lahmian Vampire Queen
and her companions were also overthrown, and the first
Vampires scattered to the four corners of the globe. The
major modern Vampire bloodlines were all formed from the
dynasties spawned by the banished Queen’s lieutenants and
allies as they settled or wandered around the Old World.
The stats presented here are for Thralls, the youngest and
most commonly encountered type of Vampire. The dreaded
Vampire Lords are ancient by Human reckoning and have
powers far beyond those of their Thralls._

## Blood Dragon Vampires

_The Order of the Blood Dragon was once a celebrated
knightly brotherhood of the Empire. In one night, however,
a Vampire of the Harkon line turned the entire order into
his Undead minions. Their original headquarters of Blood
Keep was destroyed by four orders of righteous templars
centuries ago and since that time the Blood Dragons have
wandered the Old World seeking to master the martial arts.
Their way is the way of the sword and each one strives to
become the perfect warrior._

**Talents:** Disarm, Frightening, Keen Senses, Lightning Parry,

Strike to Injure, Strike to Stun, Undead

**Special Rules:**
* _Blademaster:_ A Blood Dragon Vampire has spent
decades, if not centuries, mastering different styles
of hand-to-hand combat. At the start of his turn
each round, a Blood Dragon Vampire can reduce
the Attacks Characteristic of one of his melee
opponents by 1 as a free action. This lasts for 1
round.
* _Blood Drain:_ A Vampire that is grappling an
opponent can drain blood with his fangs. If the
Vampire inflicts at least 1 Wound on an enemy
while grappling, the victim loses 1d10% from
his Strength Characteristic as well. If the victim
survives the encounter, 1% of the lost Strength is
regained each hour.
* _Natural Necromancer:_ A Vampire can control
Undead the same way necromancers do (see
WFRP, page 161). If the Vampire actually practices
Necromancy, he does not suffer the Side Effects
that are typically associated with that Black Art.
* _Pass for Human:_ A Vampire can pass for Human
if need be, retracting his fangs and claws and
softening his features. When in this form, the
Vampire is no longer Frightening. Switching
back and forth is a free action.
* _Vampire’s Curse:_ Vampirism grants many benefits
but it also has severe drawbacks. A Vampire
cannot cross running water except over a bridge.
A Vampire shows no reflection in a mirror. A
Vampire must drink several pints of blood every
day or lose 10% from all Characteristics in
the Main Profile (losses are regained as soon as
feeding takes place). A Vampire in direct sunlight
halves all Characteristics (rounded down) and
suffers 1 Wound (regardless of Toughness Bonus
or Armour Points) per minute of exposure.

**Armour:** Heavy Armour (Full Plate Armour)

**Armour Points:** Head 5, Arms 5, Body 5, Legs 5

**Weapons:** Fangs, Claws, Hand Weapon, Lance (if
mounted), Shield

## Carstein Vampires

_Of all the Vampires that have been known to Man, the
cursed bloodline of the von Carsteins is the most infamous.
Handsome, arrogant, charismatic, and proud, the von
Carsteins are the true aristocracy of the night. It was Vlad
von Carstein, the first of their line, who brought vampirism
to the unhappy land of Sylvania. He inflicted the dread
curse on all the greatest and most powerful nobles of the
land, bound them to his will, and became the undisputed
ruler and master of an Undead kingdom at the very heart
of the Empire. Various von Carsteins have risen, fallen, and
risen again since that time and Sylvania continues to be a
haunted land where the dead do not rest easily._

immobilize opponents with nothing more than
his gaze. He can use this ability against a single
victim within 6 yards (3 squares); this is a half
action. The target can resist with a successful Will
Power Test. Otherwise, the victim is transfixed and
is considered helpless for 1 round. The Vampire
can maintain the effect each round with another
half action. The victim is not allowed further Will
Power Tests if the Vampire chooses to maintain his
transfixing gaze.

## Lahmian Vampires

_All the Vampires of the Lahmian sisterhood are said to be
descended from the Queen of Lahmia, one of the seven
Vampire nobles who escaped the destruction of that vile
city. She is said to despise men and consequently very few
Lahmians are male. Instead, enchantingly beautiful maidens
are chosen from amongst the most noble families of the
Old World and granted the Blood Kiss of the Vampire.
They then strive to gain control of Humans around them
with cunning and intrigue. No other Vampires excel in
infiltrating Human society in the same way as this shadowy
sisterhood._

**Special Rules:**
* _Blood Drain:_ See Blood Dragon Vampire for rules.
* _Domination:_ A Lahmian Vampire can use her
seductive powers to put the weak willed under her
spell. She may attempt to control a Humanoid within
6 yards (3 squares) as a full action. This is an opposed
test that pits the Vampire’s Fellowship versus her
target’s Will Power. If the Vampire wins, she gains
complete control over her target and can compel him
to do as she wishes. The target may attempt to break
free of this control after 1d10 rounds by another
opposed test. The Vampire can free a subject from
domination at any time as a free action.

## Necrarch Vampires

_Necrarch Vampires are perhaps the most terrifying of all the
lords of the night. Most Vampires retain their Human features
when they join the ranks of the Undead, but something in
the blood of the Necrarchs is tainted and foul. Their physical
corruption begins as soon as they enter the ranks of the
Undead. Skeletal and reeking with the stench of charnel
houses, the Necrarch Vampires are truly a horrifying sight.
Despite their appearance, however, Necrarchs are highly
intelligent. They live in high towers, where they study the
Heavens and the secrets of dark magic. From time to time
they summon the dead that sleep in the catacombs and
tombs around their dwellings and go conquer the lands of
the mortals._

## Strigoi Vampires

_The Strigoi are desperate creatures, hated by both the
living and the Undead. Once the proud brood of Ushoran,
the Lord of Masks, the Strigoi were laid low when Orcs
destroyed their kingdom. Now, they dare not feed on
humans for fear of attracting the attention of Witch
Hunters or other Vampires. For this reason they hide in
graveyards, living on the cold blood of recently buried
corpses. These hunched monstrosities lack any semblance
of human appearance. Packs of flesh-eating Ghouls are
attracted to these lonely creatures and often form grotesque
courts around them._

and change back as a half action.
