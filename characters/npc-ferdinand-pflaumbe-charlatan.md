# Professor Ferdinand Pflaumbe, Charlatan

_Professor Pflaumbe is a flamboyant salesman who wears a purple
jacket, has a twirled moustache and declaims rather than talks. His
Patented Anti-Aging Water is popular among the wealthy of
Marienburg — and the largest port in the Old World has a lot of
wealthy — as a means of insuring a youthful glow. How does
Pflaumbe do it? Equal parts wish-fulfilment, hypnotism and dark
magic. Unknown to anyone, his famous tonic contains blood from the
Elder Races. Pflaumbe always thought it unfair that other races live
longer lives than humans and sees the occasional back-alley murder
and blood-draining as a way of getting his own back. The blood of the
eternally youthful Elves is particularly efficacious, but the
disappearances from the Sea Elf quarter have not gone unnoticed._

spread and ravage your beautiful, delicate features. I guarantee it.”
