# Matheus Malthuisen, Barber-Surgeon

_Herr Doktor Malthuisen was weeks away from giving his life to the service
 of Morr when he had an epiphany. While reciting Morr’s Litany over
 the bodies of plague victims, Matheus realised he could have done far
 more good for these souls while they lived than he could in death. The
 next day he cast off his robes and began studying to become a Barber-
 Surgeon. It hasn’t been easy, especially without the support of his
 
 family who run a funeral home and were eager for the prestige a priest
 in the family would bring. The way they see it, keeping sick folk alive
 is robbing them of business. To pay his tuition fees Matheus made a
 deal with a ship’s captain in need of a physician. Now he has to spend
 the next two years working off his loan on board a ship called the
 Ingrid. Not a bad post, if only he could find a cure for seasickness._

 ever asks for the leeches.”
