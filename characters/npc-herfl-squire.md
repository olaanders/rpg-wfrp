# Herfl, Squire

_From an early age, Herfl found he had a much greater affinity with
animals than any human and he spent most of his free time in the
woods near his village. He would have been a good farmer or horse-
trader, but Fate played a hand. One day, a host of knights rode into
town in pursuit of some Beastmen raiders. The bloody battle fell upon
the townsfolk, and Herfl fought without fear to save his loved ones.
After the battle one of the knights, Sir Aghmar, offered to make Herfl
his squire. Such a lofty life was a chance not to be missed, so Herfl left
with the stranger. Unfortunately, Herfl doesn’t want to be a knight at
all and only enjoys the bits with the horses. Missing his forest friends
and sick of being beaten for his lack of diligence, it’s only a matter of
time before Herfl runs away and seeks his fortune elsewhere — but Sir
Aghmar will not look kindly upon anyone taking up with his property._
