# Hansup, Ogre Watchman
_Oh, how people laughed when Hansup the Ogre was sworn into the
 Nuln City Watch. Oh, how they snickered as he got his nickname,
 based on the first thing he always said. Oh, how they chortled when
 they realised he was stupid even for an Ogre. Nobody is laughing any
 more. Especially not the city’s criminals. The simple fact is that
 Hansup is just too stupid to be tricked, cajoled or bargained with. He
 knows the law (he taught himself to read by reading the town charter)
 and if he sees anyone doing anything illegal, he catches them in his
 net and carries them straight to the Watch House, where his boss
 sorts them out. Methodical, implacable and scrupulously honest,
 Hansup is a rogue’s worst nightmare. So much so that every crime
 lord in the city has put a price on his head — and several nobles and
 high-ranked watchmen are similarly concerned about his career._
