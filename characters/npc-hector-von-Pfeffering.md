# Hector von Pfeffering, Tollkeeper

_As part of their feudal duties to the Baron, one person from the town
of Torbenburg has to man the toll station on the nearby river,
collecting levies for the Empire of five pence for a rowboat, ten for a
barge. Despite not being on a rich trade route and rarely targeted by
bandits and ruffians, Hector had heard all the stories and it was just
typical of his luck that he be the one chosen for the duty this year. He
is absolutely convinced that he is going to die and assumes every
traveller is there to kill him. Ironically, his habits have endeared him
to travellers and more and more people are leaving the road and
travelling by water, just for a humorous encounter with “Nervous
Hector”. He has become so much of an attraction that Torbenburg is
becoming more prosperous by the day, and travellers are so fond of
him they will stand with him — or seek bloody vengeance — should
anything bad ever actually befall the poor lad._
