# Frida Vaksmann, Rogue

_Frida is addicted to taking risks and incapable of thinking ahead. She
made the mistake of paying off a large gambling debt to the Valantina
gang with a loan from the Resurrection Brothers, then trying to earn
money to pay off the loan by gambling even more. She’s stuck in a
vicious cycle of mounting debts, in it up to her waist and sinking fast.
Nuln is becoming a very dangerous place for her as certain
establishments have realised she’s cheating and time is running out
on the original loan. She’s getting desperate and is willing to sign up
for any job or scam, no matter how dangerous, as long as the rewards
are significant or the company easily fooled into being her
bodyguards. But unless she gets a very big break very soon, Frida will
have to leave town in a great hurry or face sleeping with the fishes._
