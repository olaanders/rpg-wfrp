# Doctor Zindeá, Elf Physician

_There are few who can stomach the idea of an Elven doctor and no
college will recognise a female one, so Dr Zindeá doesn’t get a lot of
patients. This means she charges very reasonably and is frequented
mostly by itinerant adventurers or those not keen on attracting
attention. Dr Zindeá prefers it this way, having little need for money
and no interest in tending mundane afflictions like sniffles or the pox.
She is rather a voracious student of anatomy and physiology and
never ceases to be amazed by the wondrous things she finds inside
her patients’ bodies. She considers herself an explorer of the holiest —
and most forbidden — of temples, and is working on her magnum
opus: a definitive guide to the human body, complete with sketches.
She does not, however, ever stoop to employing ‘resurrection men’._
