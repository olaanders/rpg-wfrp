# Edgar Furfoot, Halfling Hunter
_Edgar’s permanently furrowed brow and gravely voice are offset by his
soft, Halfling pot-belly: he’s mean but not lean. Around the campfire
the members of the Free Forester Company like to cajole him into
telling the story of how a band of vicious Beastmen slaughtered his
family and burned their farmland to the ground. Not a word of it is
true. In reality he was just a bored country boy who ran away from
the farm to seek a more exciting life; his grim looks and terse silences
are all just an act. Life certainly is more exciting as a Forest Ranger,
with the Company hire themselves out as scouts and archers with
unparalleled woodland expertise, helping to clear the forests of
greenskins and the altered. It certainly beats milking cows, although
Edgar still gets homesick for one thing: his mothers’ pies_

> Quote: “You wouldn’t last a minute in the wilds, city boy. I may be
half your height, but I’m twice the man.”
