# Khandar the Runner, Dwarf Scout

_Khandar’s parents used to joke that she was running in the womb.
True or not, she took to being a runner almost as soon as she could
walk and was the youngest runebearer ever heard of in her Hold.
Khandar isn’t just fast; she has a deep, burning desire to get to her
next destination, whatever it is. Eventually, this left her dissatisfied
with simply bearing messages between Dwarfholds and back, so she
left the underworld to explore the surface as well. She has since
travelled from one end of the World’s Edge Mountains to the other and
probably knows them better than any being alive — and yet still, she
says, they have innumerable secrets to teach her and new wonders to
amaze her. And until she has seen it all, she will never stop running._
