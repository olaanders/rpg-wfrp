# Clever Tom, Halfling Rogue

_Clever Tom (aka Poor Tom or Foolish Tom when pulling a scam) was
born very smart, and his schoolmates made him pay for that. Tom
grew up to be even smarter, and to be a consummate misanthrope. In
his eyes, almost all people are stupid, and as such, deserve to be
swindled as a public service. Tom would agree with J.P. Morgan that it
is morally reprehensible for a fool not to be parted from his money.
Naturally, Tom left the Moot quite young, seeking easier prey. He
ended up in Altdorf, where tourism provides an endlessly renewed
supply of suckers. So much so that Tom has begun to grow weary of
his work. Perhaps, he thinks, there are bigger fish to fry out there._
