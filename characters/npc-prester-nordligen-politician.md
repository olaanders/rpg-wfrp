# Prester Nordlingen, Politician

_Prester was born with a gift for figures and an over-bearing mother
 who insisted he put that to good use in service to their local lord. His
 local lord also insisted that Prester would make a wonderful tax
 collector, and he did indeed. His lord was also correct in his insistence
 that Prester would make a wonderful sheriff as well, and now Prester
 is in charge of a whole shire. Which would be wonderful if Prester
 didn’t hate his job. Mathematically, he understands that taxes are
 important but he hates having to ask people for them, especially when
 they cry, or gnash their teeth, or wail that there will now be no food
 for little Johann. He’d love to help, he really would, but he has to fill
 in his little boxes in his ledger or the lord will get cross. Prester
 dreams of one day being an adventurer, but that won’t happen while
 he’s stuck trying to fill the Baron’s quotas, so in the meantime he’ll
 also pay handsomely for tales of derring do from the horse’s mouth._
