# Karl Empresser, Duellist

_Karl is a man who knows well where his talents lie — hurting people,
scaring people and being a complete bastard. Naturally he rose
quickly through the ranks of the militia and was noticed by Baron von
Damenhosen who brought him into his personal service and is
grooming him to be his personal bodyguard, strongarm and settler of
personal disputes. When not standing next to his boss looking scary,
Karl is a troubleshooter; he finds people who are causing the Baron
trouble and shoots them. Karl’s tough, canny and won’t back down
from a fight if cornered, but he is also lazy. Wherever possible he’d
rather glare at someone to make them do something rather than do it
himself. In short, a bully — but a very dangerous one._
